1. Added review_count column for the training/testing data, considering that can affect the business's star
2. Used Z-score for review_count to abstract the data area
3. Removed some columns in business data sets and review data sets to make more concise calculation
4. Looped model training to jump out of local optimum using ModelCheckpoint
5. We think Classification model would be better for prediction because the review stars go by multiplication of 0.5 (discrete value)
--> we can categorize them as [very bad/bad/average/good/very good]
